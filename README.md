# Performance-Matrix-&-Decision-Tree

In pattern recognition, the performance of a classifier can be evaluated using various metrics that measure its accuracy and
effectiveness in recognizing and classifying different patterns. Some common metrics-

1. Confusion matrix: A confusion matrix is a table that summarizes the number of correct and incorrect predictions made by a
classifier. It provides a breakdown of how many patterns were classified into each category or class, as well as how many
patterns were misclassified.

2. Accuracy: Accuracy is a measure of how well a classifier performs in terms of the percentage of correctly classified patterns. It is
calculated as the ratio of the number of correctly classified patterns to the total number of patterns.

3. Precision and Recall: Precision measures the proportion of correctly classified patterns among those that were predicted to
belong to a particular class. Recall measures the proportion of correctly classified patterns among those that actually belong to a
particular class.

4. F1-score: The F1-score is a measure of the balance between precision and recall. It is calculated as the harmonic mean of
precision and recall and provides a single score that summarizes the overall performance of a classifier.

5. ROC curve and AUC: The Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve is a graphical representation of the trade-off between
the true positive rate and false positive rate for different classification thresholds.

These metrics can be used to evaluate the performance of a classifier on a test dataset, which is a separate dataset that is not used
during training. By comparing the performance of different classifiers using these metrics, we can select the best classifier for a
particular pattern recognition task.

# Confusion-Matrix

▪ TP: Algo predicts Yes, and
the actual value is Yes!

▪ FP: Algo predicts Yes, but
the actual value is No!

▪ FN: Algo predicts No, and
the actual value is Yes!

▪ TN: Algo predicts No, and
the actual value is No!
